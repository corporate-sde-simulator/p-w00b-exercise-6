> **Goal:** Practice reviewing code and writing PR comments like a real engineer.

## Instructions

### Part A: Study the Reference (5 min)
Read `REFERENCE.md` — it explains how Pull Requests work in a corporate environment.

### Part B: Review a Mock PR (15 min)
Open `sample_pr.md`. It contains a PR with intentional issues. Your job:

1. **Read the PR description** — does it explain the change clearly?
2. **Review each changed file** — find issues (bugs, style problems, missing tests)
3. **Write 3 review comments** in the `Your Review` section at the bottom
4. **Give a verdict:** Approve, Request Changes, or Comment

### Self-Check
Good PR reviews are specific, actionable, and kind. Compare your comments
against the `expected_feedback.md` file after you're done.
